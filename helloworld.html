      economy, the first drug trend report from IngenioRx demonstrates that, 
      by analyzing information about drugs costs prescribed to consumers 
      through both their Medical and Pharmacy benefits, health plans can 
      implement effective programs and care management strategies that will 
      limit additional drug price increases and may reduce costs.

      IngenioRx is the stand alone PBM established by Anthem, Inc., one of the 
      nation’s leading health benefits companies. The IngenioRx report, titled 
      “<a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" target="_blank" href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffile.anthem.com%2F2017_Drug_Trend_Report.pdf&amp;esheet=51814441&amp;newsitemid=20180531005074&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Taking+a+Total+View&amp;index=1&amp;md5=5d5e7410cd3aebbac3f0fb00aa92e62c" rel="nofollow">Taking 
      a Total View</a>,” analyzed both Medical and Pharmacy claims information 
      on prescription drugs provided to consumers through Anthem’s affiliated 
      employer-based health plans in 14 states. The report demonstrated, with 
      access to both Medical and Pharmacy Claims, overall 2017 drug costs 
      increased by only two percent. Without the ability to manage both 
      Medical and Pharmacy claims, the same drug costs for 2017 would have 
      increased by six percent.

      a Total View</a>” represents the first comprehensive study of drug costs 
      covered under both the Medical and Pharmacy benefits of consumers rather 
      than only the Pharmacy benefit,” said Colleen Haines, Vice President, 
      Clinical and Specialty Pharmacy, IngenioRx. “Because IngenioRx is able 
      to access the data from both Medical and Pharmacy benefits, we have a 
      full picture of drugs used by consumers. This allows us to more 
      accurately assess the total drug trend and develop the right programs 
      and strategies that can lead to better health outcomes and more 
      affordability for consumers and employers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The report also demonstrated that the combination of insights from both 
      Medical and Pharmacy provided enhanced visibility to changes in 
      medication use and drug costs. The cost of a drug can vary if it is 
      covered under a Medical vs. Pharmacy benefit and also based on where the 
      drug is administered. For example, the report identified that 94 percent 
      of the dollars spent on immune deficiency drugs and 63 percent of the 
      dollars spent on cancer drugs were paid by the Medical benefit instead 
      of the Pharmacy benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The rising price of drugs is a concern for the entire health care 
      system as the impact of this cost is felt and paid for by all of us,” 
      said Deepti Jain, Chief Operating Officer, IngenioRx. “That’s why it’s 
      so important to have a deep understanding of actual drug use and costs. 
      Having access to the total view is critical to knowing how to implement 
      benefits, evidence-based drug lists and programs that result in improved 
      health outcomes, while keeping costs affordable as possible for all 
      Americans.”
